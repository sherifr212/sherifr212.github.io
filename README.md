## SCSS Compilation in Jekyll

Jekyll automatically compiles SCSS files into CSS. Ensure your SCSS files are placed in the `/sass/` directory or `_sass` for partials. The output CSS will be generated in the `_site/assets/css/` directory.

To build the site and process SCSS, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```
